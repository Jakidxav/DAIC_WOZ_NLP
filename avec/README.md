NLP / linguistic approach to modelling the DAIC-WOZ dataset with PHQ8 scores for the newly-released DAIC-WOZ data set for the [2019 AVEC challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/avec2019/home?authuser=0).

Two noteable difference exist between the 2019 version of the DAIC data and the previous iteration:
- First, the robotic voice of Ellie has been stripped from the transcripts.
- Second, no semantic data was included in this version of the data. In the previous iteration, this looked like [laughter] or <laughter> (both types of brackets were found when processing it).
