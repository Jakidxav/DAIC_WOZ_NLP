The processing steps for the newly-released DAIC-WOZ data set for the [2019 AVEC challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/avec2019/home?authuser=0) follow most of the same processing steps as those shown in the old_daic_woz sub-repository. However, for the old dataset I used a lot of Jupyter Notebooks to show how processing steps were carried out, as well as output from most of those steps. For the challenge's new dataset, I have included the processing steps that don't have graphical output as Python files so that they can be run from the command line.
